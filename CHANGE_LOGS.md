## [1.7.0] — April 3, 2026

### Phase 6 — Punishment System + Dispute Grace Period

---

#### Dispute Grace Period (Step 4 — Completed)

**New Component — `DisputeGraceModal`**

Shown to both players immediately when `wager.status === 'disputed'` and `grace_conceded_by` is null. Gives players a chance to admit they voted wrong before a moderator is pulled in. No countdown — the moderator search runs silently in the background.

If either player taps "I was wrong", `concedeDispute` is called on `secure-wager`. The concession is resolved on-chain instantly via `process-concession` with no moderator fee. The honesty event is logged to `player_behaviour_log` positively. The moderator popup is never shown if concession wins the race.

**New Edge Function — `process-concession`**

Handles on-chain resolution for grace period concessions. Calls `resolve_wager` (90/10 split) or `close_wager` (draw). Does NOT apply punishment tiers — concession rewards honesty. Logs a positive `honesty_concession` event to `player_behaviour_log`.

**New `secure-wager` action — `concedeDispute`**

Validates `status === 'disputed'`, stamps `grace_conceded_by` and `grace_conceded_at`, triggers `process-concession`, and notifies both players.

---

#### Auto-Escalating Punishment Tiers (Step 6 — Completed)

**New Edge Function — `process-verdict`**

Called after a moderator submits a verdict. Handles full on-chain settlement and applies punishment to the dispute loser based on their `dispute_loss` offense count in `punishment_log`:

| Offense # | Punishment |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Warning — no suspension |
| 2 | 24h suspension |
| 3 | 72h suspension |
| 4 | 7-day (168h) suspension |
| 5+ | Indefinite ban (`suspension_ends_at` = null) |

Punishment is written to `punishment_log` (immutable) and reflected on the player row (`is_suspended`, `suspension_ends_at`). `cannot_determine` verdicts skip punishment and escalate to admin. `applyPunishment` catches its own exceptions — a punishment failure never blocks verdict settlement.

Also handles: on-chain `resolve_wager` or `close_wager`, winner/loser stats update, `wager_transactions` ledger entries, and notifications to both players + moderator.

**New Hook — `useDisputeGrace`**

Exports `useConcede()` — mutation that calls `concedeDispute` via `invokeSecureWager`. Allows 30s timeout for on-chain resolution.

---

#### New Admin Pages

- **`/itszaadminlogin/behaviour-flags`** — Aggregates `player_behaviour_log` per player into risk scores. Tracks false votes, dispute losses, and moderator reports with per-event weights. Admins can drill into full event history per player.
- **`/itszaadminlogin/username-appeals`** — Review queue for username ownership appeals filed by players.
- **`/itszaadminlogin/username-changes`** — Review queue for formal username change/rebind requests.

---

#### New Edge Functions — Moderation Infrastructure

**`assign-moderator`**

Called fire-and-forget from `secure-wager/actions.ts` (`handleSubmitVote`) when a dispute is created, and by `moderation-timeout` on retry. Finds the eligible moderator with the lowest `moderation_skipped_count` (not a participant, not suspended, has `moderation_requests_enabled = true`, not already tried on this wager). Inserts a `moderation_requests` row with `deadline = now + 30s` and sends an in-app notification.

**`moderation-timeout`**

Triggered by pg_cron every minute. Handles two cases:
- **Pending timeout** — moderator didn't accept within 30s → `status = 'timed_out'` → `assign-moderator` retried
- **Accepted timeout** — moderator accepted but didn't submit verdict within decision window → `status = 'timed_out'` → skip count incremented atomically via `increment_moderation_skip_count` RPC → `assign-moderator` retried

Skip count updates run concurrently with `Promise.all` — no sequential blocking in loops.

---

#### New Player-Facing Features

**Player Settings Page (`/settings`)**
- Push notification toggle (per event type)
- Moderation assignment opt-in/opt-out (`moderation_requests_enabled`)
- Managed via `GET/PATCH /api/settings` with session token auth
- `usePlayerSettings` hook with optimistic updates and camelCase↔snake_case mapping

**Username Binding System**
- `GameAccountCard` updated with bind/appeal/change-request flows for PUBG, CODM, Free Fire
- `useUsernameBinding` hook — `useBindUsername`, `useUsernameAppeal`, `useSubmitChangeRequest` mutations
- `/api/username/bind` — bind game username; returns `USERNAME_TAKEN` if conflict → triggers appeal flow
- `/api/username/appeal` — file ownership appeal; notifies current holder
- `/api/username/appeal/respond` — holder releases or contests; contested appeals go to admin queue
- `/api/username/change-request` — formal rebind request; max 2 approved/pending per game per 12 months enforced server-side
- PUBG binding calls `/api/pubg/verify-username` first (live PUBG API lookup); falls back to manual confirmation if `PUBG_API_KEY` not configured

---

### Bug Fixes (April 2, 2026 — Moderation System Hardening)

**Bug 1 — `ModerationRequestModal` stale closure on countdown auto-dismiss**

The 30s countdown timer called `onDismissed` via a closure captured at mount. If the parent re-rendered before the timer fired, the stale closure wouldn't clear context state — popup appeared frozen or failed to transition.

Fix: `onDismissed` and `onAccepted` stored in `useRef`, synced via `useEffect`. Handlers call `ref.current()` instead of the raw prop.

File: `src/components/ModerationRequestModal.tsx`

---

**Bug 2 — `moderation-timeout` pg_cron job was never activated**

The edge function was deployed but the pg_cron schedule was never run in the SQL editor — it existed only as a comment. Timed-out requests were never marked `timed_out` and never reassigned. The retry loop was completely inactive.

Fix: pg_cron job now documented and required in the deployment checklist. See deployment guide Step 2.

---

**Bug 3 — Hard refresh re-showed already-dismissed moderation popup**

`seenModerationRequestIds` was an in-memory `useRef<Set<string>>` — reset on every page load. Pending `moderation_requests` rows in the DB would re-trigger the popup after a hard refresh.

Fix: `seenModerationRequestIds` now initialises from `sessionStorage` (key `gg:seen_mod_requests`) and writes back on every addition.

File: `src/contexts/GameEventContext.tsx`

---

**Bug 4 — Skip count increment in `moderation-timeout` was not atomic**

Read-then-write pattern (`SELECT count`, then `UPDATE count + 1`) meant overlapping cron ticks could both read the same value and produce only one increment.

Fix: Replaced with `increment_moderation_skip_count(p_wallet)` Postgres RPC — single atomic `UPDATE ... SET count = count + 1`.

File: `supabase/functions/moderation-timeout/index.ts`

---

**Bug 5 — Same race condition in `decline/route.ts`**

`POST /api/moderation/decline` had the identical read-then-write pattern. Simultaneous cron timeout + manual decline within the 30s window could lose one increment.

Fix: Same `increment_moderation_skip_count` RPC.

File: `src/app/api/moderation/decline/route.ts`

---

**Bug 6 — `increment_moderation_skip_count` RPC did not exist**

Both Bug 4 and Bug 5 fixes depend on this Postgres function. It was not present in the DB.

Fix:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_moderation_skip_count(p_wallet text)
RETURNS void LANGUAGE sql AS $$
  UPDATE players SET moderation_skipped_count = moderation_skipped_count + 1
  WHERE wallet_address = p_wallet;
$$;
```

---

### Bug Fixes (March 30, 2026)

**Bug — Player B Deposit Ordering (`ReadyRoomModal`)**

`join_wager` reads `stake_lamports` from the WagerAccount PDA that `create_wager` initialises. If Player A's transaction hadn't confirmed when Player B's fired, the PDA didn't exist — the program fell back to minimum rent (~0.00008 SOL).

Fix: Player B polls `wagerRef.current.deposit_player_a` every 2s (up to 2 min) before calling `joinWagerOnChain`. `wagerRef` stays in sync with Realtime — poll resolves as soon as `recordOnChainCreate` sets `deposit_player_a = true`. Player B sees a spinner during the wait; countdown and Ready button are unaffected.

---

---

## [1.6.0] — March 28, 2026

### Step 3 — Peer Voting Flow (CODM / PUBG / Free Fire)

**New Components**
- `GameCompleteModal` — both players confirm match is done; shows live 10s countdown synced to `game_complete_deadline` once both confirmed; non-dismissable during countdown
- `VotingModal` — 5-minute vote window; player picks winner or draw; shows opponent vote status via Realtime; retract button available while opponent hasn't voted; resolves or disputes automatically when both votes in

**New Hooks**
- `useGameComplete.ts` — `useMarkGameComplete` mutation calling `markGameComplete` in `secure-wager`
- `useVoting.ts` — `useSubmitVote`, `useRetractVote`, `deriveVoteOutcome` utility

**New Edge Function Actions** (in `secure-wager`)
- `markGameComplete` — sets `game_complete_a/b`; when both true: stamps `game_complete_deadline` (NOW+10s) and `vote_deadline` (NOW+5m10s)
- `submitVote` — sets `vote_player_a/b`; if votes agree → on-chain resolve; if mismatch → `disputed`
- `retractVote` — clears caller's vote (only while opponent hasn't voted)

**Page Wiring**
- `my-wagers/page.tsx` — `GameCompleteModal` + `VotingModal` imported, state managed, `handleBothConfirmed` chains the two modals; `WagerRow` Vote button label changes dynamically based on confirmation state
- `arena/page.tsx` — same wiring; `handleWatchGame` now routes non-chess wagers in `voting` state to `GameCompleteModal` or `VotingModal` instead of `LiveGameModal`

**Wager Type Extensions** (`useWagers.ts`)
- `game_complete_a`, `game_complete_b`, `game_complete_deadline` on `Wager` interface
- `vote_a_at`, `vote_b_at`, `vote_deadline` on `Wager` interface

**Other**
- Free Fire (`free_fire`) added to `getGameData` in both pages
- `GameCompleteModal` and `VotingModal` receive live wager from React Query cache — no second Supabase subscription created inside either modal

## Known Issues

### Current (April 3, 2026)

- `wager_messages`, v1.5.0/v1.6.0/v1.7.0 player/wager columns, and `free_fire` game type are not reflected in auto-generated `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` — worked around with `as any` casts and local interface definitions. Re-run `supabase gen types typescript` after any schema change.
- `retractable` wager status exists in DB enum but is unused in the current flow.
- High latency on leaderboard queries with > 100k players (requires sharding).
- Occasional delays in Lichess game data synchronization.
- Admin analytics need optimization for large datasets.
- 2FA implementation requires email service integration.
- No automated lift for timed suspensions — `is_suspended` must be cleared manually or via a scheduled job when `suspension_ends_at` is reached. A pg_cron suspension-lift job is planned.

### Fixed (April 3, 2026 — v1.7.0)

- [x] `ModerationRequestModal` — stale closure on `onDismissed`/`onAccepted` refs
- [x] `GameEventContext` — `seenModerationRequestIds` not persisted across hard refresh

- [x] `increment_moderation_skip_count` SQL RPC — created and live
- [x] pg_cron job `moderation-timeout` — scheduled and verified active
- [x] Player B deposit ordering race — polling guard added in `runDepositFlow`

### Fixed (v1.6.0)

- [x] Race condition in `secure-wager` — atomic DB status guard prevents duplicate tx processing
- [x] Mobile wallet signing — switched to `sendTransaction` via wallet adapter
- [x] `useAutoCreatePlayer` deduplication — prevents double player creation on reconnect
- [x] `game_complete_deadline` comment in DB_SCHEMA.md incorrectly said "15 min" — corrected to 10s

### Fixed (v1.5.0)

- [x] Admin authentication and session management
- [x] Wallet verification for admin actions
- [x] Audit logging for compliance
- [x] Dispute resolution workflow
- [x] Duplicate transaction prevention via unique tx signatures

### Fixed (v1.0.0)
