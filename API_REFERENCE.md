# GameGambit API Reference

## Overview

GameGambit provides a REST API and a set of Supabase edge functions for managing wagers, players, social features, side bets, and admin functions on Solana.

**Two authentication methods:**
- **Player API** — Wallet session token (`X-Session-Token` header) issued by `verify-wallet`
- **Admin API** — JWT bearer token issued by `/api/admin/auth/login`

---

## Authentication

### Player Session Token

All player-facing edge function calls require a wallet session token:

```http
X-Session-Token: <session_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Session tokens are Ed25519 wallet signatures issued by `verify-wallet` and managed by `useWalletAuth`. They expire and trigger a `gg:session-expired` custom DOM event when stale.

### Admin JWT

Admin panel routes require a JWT in the `Authorization` header or as an httpOnly cookie (set automatically on login):

```http
Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## Rate Limiting

Per-wallet sliding window via `rate_limit_logs`:

| Endpoint Type | Window | Max Requests |
|---|---|---|
| Public | 60s | 100 |
| API | 60s | 50 |
| Auth | 15 min | 5 |
| Wager creation | 60s | 10 |

`notifyChat` additionally enforces 1 push notification per wager per 5 minutes at the application level.

## Edge Functions

### `secure-wager`

All wager lifecycle actions. Requires `X-Session-Token`.

| Action | Auth | Who Can Call | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| `create` | ✅ | Any player | INSERT new wager, create on-chain PDA |
| `join` | ✅ | Any player (not owner) | UPDATE status → joined |
| `edit` | ✅ | Player A only | UPDATE stake/stream_url/is_public (status = created only) |
| `applyProposal` | ✅ | Either participant | Apply accepted proposal — bypasses owner-only restriction |
| `notifyChat` | ✅ | Either participant | INSERT notification to opponent (rate-limited: 1/5min/wager) |
| `notifyProposal` | ✅ | Either participant | INSERT notification to opponent for new proposals |
| `delete` | ✅ | Player A only | DELETE wager (status = created only) |
| `setReady` | ✅ | Either participant | Calls `set_player_ready` DB RPC |
| `startGame` | ✅ | Either participant | UPDATE status → voting; creates Lichess game (chess) |
| `recordOnChainCreate` | ✅ | Player A only | UPDATE deposit_player_a = true, tx_signature_a |
| `recordOnChainJoin` | ✅ | Player B only | UPDATE deposit_player_b = true, tx_signature_b |
| `cancelWager` | ✅ | Either participant | UPDATE status → cancelled; trigger on-chain refund |
| `concedeDispute` | ✅ | Either participant | Grace period concession; resolves on-chain, no mod fee |
| `markGameComplete` | ✅ | Either participant | Sets game_complete_a/b; when both set, stamps deadlines |
| `submitVote` | ✅ | Either participant | Sets vote_player_a/b; agree → auto-resolve; disagree → disputed |
| `retractVote` | ✅ | Either participant | Clears caller's vote (only while opponent hasn't voted) |

---

### `secure-player`

Player profile management. Requires `X-Session-Token`.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | INSERT new player row (accepts optional `referrerCode`) |
| `update` | UPDATE player profile fields (username, bio, avatar, game usernames) |

---

### `secure-bet`

Spectator side bet actions. Requires `X-Session-Token`. New in v1.8.0.

| Action | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `place` | ✅ | Transfer SOL to platform wallet on-chain; INSERT bet row with 30-min expiry. Blocked if wager is `voting`/`resolved`/`cancelled`. Players cannot bet on their own match. |
| `counter` | ✅ | Propose different amount; status → `countered` |
| `accept` | ✅ | Second party sends SOL to platform wallet; status → `matched` |
| `cancel` | ✅ | Owner cancels open (unmatched) bet; platform wallet refunds SOL |
| `resolveForWager` | ✅ | Called after wager resolves. Pays winners 95% of pot, refunds unmatched open bets, marks all as resolved/expired. |

**Request body shape (place):**
```json
{
  "action": "place",
  "wagerId": "uuid",
  "backedPlayer": "player_a",
  "amountLamports": 500000000,
  "txSignature": "5yBGvU..."
}
```

---

### `admin-action`

Admin dispute resolution. Requires admin JWT. Called via `/api/admin/action`.

| Action | Min Role | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `forceResolve` | moderator | Resolve wager with given winner on-chain |
| `forceDraw` | moderator | Resolve as draw on-chain |
| `forceCancel` | moderator | Cancel wager on-chain |
| `banPlayer` | admin | Ban player wallet |
| `unbanPlayer` | admin | Unban player wallet |

---

### `resolve-wager`

Low-level on-chain settlement. Internal only — not called from the frontend.

Derives WagerAccount PDA → builds `resolve_wager` (90–95% to winner) or `close_wager` (draw/cancel refund) → signs and sends → calls `update_winner_stats` / `update_loser_stats` RPCs → INSERTs `wager_transactions` records.

---

### `process-verdict`

Called after moderator submits verdict. On-chain settlement + 5-tier auto-punishment.

---

### `process-concession`

Called when player concedes during dispute grace period. On-chain `resolve_wager` (no mod fee, no punishment). Logs positive honesty event.

---

### `assign-moderator`

Fire-and-forget. Finds eligible moderator (lowest `moderation_skipped_count`, not a participant, not suspended, `moderation_requests_enabled = true`). Inserts `moderation_requests` row.

---

### `moderation-timeout`

Triggered by pg_cron every minute. Marks expired requests `timed_out`, increments skip count atomically, retries `assign-moderator`.

---

### `check-chess-games`

Polls Lichess API for completed games. Triggered by cron-job.org every 60s.

---

### `verify-wallet`

Issues Ed25519 session token from wallet signature.

## Error Codes

| HTTP Code | Meaning |

| 403 | Forbidden — caller not permitted for this action |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 409 | Conflict — e.g. wager status prevents this action |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |

---

## Security Notes

- All state transitions require a valid Ed25519 session token
- DB triggers (`protect_player_sensitive_fields`, `protect_wager_sensitive_fields`) prevent direct client writes to sensitive fields — all mutations must go through edge functions
- `PLATFORM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` must be set as an edge function secret for `secure-bet` payouts
- Players cannot bet on their own wager in `secure-bet`
- Moderator wallet is verified server-side against the `moderation_requests` row before any mutation
- Verdict is irreversible once submitted
